Osaka University was founded in 1931 as the sixth imperial university of Japan through strong demand from the business 
and government sectors of Osaka, as well as the people of Osaka City and Prefecture. The roots of Osaka University can 
be found in Kaitokudo and Tekijuku of the Edo period. The academic culture and spirit of these two places of 
scholarship are inherited even today, and the spirit of innovation and a restless spirit of challenge serve as the 
cornerstone for our endeavors in education and research. And after a huge undertaking merging Osaka University with 
Osaka University of Foreign Studies in 2007, the university has shown that it will continue to develop as one of
 Japan's leading comprehensive research universities.
